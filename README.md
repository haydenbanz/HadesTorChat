# HadesTorChat: Secure chat application built for anonymous communication


## üìñ Description
HadesTorChat is a secure chat application built for anonymous communication over the Tor network. It allows users to send messages while maintaining privacy. The system uses Python for backend functionality and PyQt & Tkinter for the user interface. With features like message encryption and anonymous routing through a hidden service, it provides a platform for confidential discussions. It is designed for deployment on Kali Linux and includes an interactive, transparent UI overlay similar to Conky.

## Key Features
- **Anonymous Communication**: Utilizes the Tor network to ensure secure, anonymous messaging.
- **Secure Chat**: End-to-end encryption for all messages exchanged through the platform.
- **PyQt & Tkinter GUI**: Features a sleek, interactive user interface using PyQt.
- **Transparent UI Overlay**: Customizable and lightweight overlay for chat windows, inspired by Conky.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Can be deployed on Linux, with a focus on Kali Linux.
- **Tor Hidden Service**: Built on a .onion address for added privacy and anonymity.
- **Python-Powered**: Developed using Python, making it highly customizable and extendable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

HadesTorChat is designed for secure, anonymous communication over the Tor network. While every effort is made to protect your privacy, **no system is entirely immune to vulnerabilities**. Use this software responsibly, and be aware of the risks associated with online anonymity.

- üõ°Ô∏è **Data Security**: Ensure you are using the latest version for the best security practices.
- üåê **Network Privacy**: Tor may slow down your connection due to its anonymization techniques.
- üîí **Responsibility**: Users are responsible for their own actions while using HadesTorChat.

The creators of HadesTorChat are **not liable** for any misuse of the platform.<br>
Violations will be subject to legal action and may result in severe penalties.<br>
Please ensure all usage complies with applicable laws and regulations.<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before installing and running **HadesTorChat**, make sure you have the following:

- üêç **Python 3.6+**: Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed.
- üßÖ **Tor**: Ensure you have Tor installed and configured on your system.
- üì¶ **Python Packages**: Install required Python libraries with:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
  - üíª **Kali Linux (Recommended)**: Although **HadesTorChat** is cross-platform, Kali Linux is the recommended environment for maximum security. Other Linux distributions such as Ubuntu or Debian-based are also supported to run server.py. However, **HadesTorChat** only works on Linux, while the client-side can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- üîê **PyQt & Tkinter**: Both PyQt and Tkinter are required for the graphical user interface (GUI) to function properly.

## üîß Configuration

### Server-Side Setup

1. **Install Tor** on your Linux server using the following command:

`
  pip install -r requirements.txt
`
Configure the Tor Hidden Service by editing the Tor configuration file (/etc/tor/torrc):
 -Uncomment the following line to enable the SOCKS port:

`
 SocksPort 9050  # Default: Bind to localhost:9050 for local connections.
`
-Add the hidden service configuration 

`
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_chat/
HiddenServicePort 9050 127.0.0.1:5000
`
-Retrieve the Onion URL: After restarting the Tor service, you can get your onion address by running:
`
sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service_chat/hostname
`

### Client-Side Setup
For the client-side, you need to update the following files to point to your onion service:
-Edit client.py, chat.py, and send.py to replace YOUR_ONION_URL with your actual .onion address:

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Start by cloning the **HadesTorChat** repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/haydenbanz/HadesTorChat
     cd HadesTorChat/server
   sudo service tor start 
   python server.py
    ```
-Run the Server: Navigate to the server folder and run server.py to start the chat server:
-Run the Client: You can choose between two client-side options:

  PyQt Overlay (Modern): Navigate to the client folder and run chat.py. This will create an interactive overlay on your home screen similar to Conky:
`
python chat.py
`
or  in below you can send messgaes in overlay
`
python send.py
`
  Tkinter Client (Old School): For a more traditional interface, run client.py:
  
`
python client.py
`
